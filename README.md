# random_stuff
Random small programs i wrote for various reasons and want to keep track of

### faixa.R
Small R program that calculates enzimatic parameters of a luciferase with substrate inhibition using non linear least squares. The input is an excel tables with light emission per time. This is very specific program for the experiments that I did, and it's not meant to be a general enzimatic parameter calculator.

### aligner.c
Rustic aminoacid aligner that reads fasta sequences and outputs the best alignment it could make from them

### line_breaker.c
Tiny program that adds line breaks after each word in a name list separated by spaces
